Being frustrated with existing options for creating ternary plots, I thought a better, quicker option should be available. After finding Daven Quinn's <a href="https://github.com/davenquinn/d3-ternary" target="_blank">d3-ternary library</a> I decided to hack together a small webpage for quickly making ternary plots for some of my courses. Afterwards I decided to develop it into a more user-friendly tool available to anyone for free.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Daven Quinn for developing the d3-ternary library.
Download option based on <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/svg-crowbar/" target="_blank">SVG Crowbar</a>.
Explanation slides made with <a href="https://revealjs.com" targer="_blank">reveal.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gcalmettes/reveal.js-d3" target="_blank">reveald3</a>.

If you have found a bug or would like to request a feature than I want to hear about it!.
</p>

<p>
Being frustrated with existing options for creating ternary plots, I thought a better, quicker option should be available. After finding Daven Quinn's <a href="https://github.com/davenquinn/d3-ternary" target="_blank">d3-ternary library</a> I decided to hack together a small webpage for quickly making ternary plots for some of my courses. Afterwards I dediced to develop into a more user-friendly tool available to anyone for free.

<p>
Thanks to Daven Quinn for developing the d3-ternary library.

Download option based on <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/svg-crowbar/" target="_blank">SVG Crowbar</a> 
</p>
SVG because its easily editable in your favorite vector graphics editor and supported by all browsers.

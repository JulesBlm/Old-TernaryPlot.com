# Old TernaryPlot.com

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7b25a2ca-a40b-4763-90e5-16e21dcc7024/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ternaryplot/deploys)

The source code for my side project: the old version of [TernaryPlot.com](https://ternaryplot.netlify.app/). A single purpose website to quickly and freely generate ternary plots. This has since been replaced with a new version that is no longer open source: check out the new [TernaryPlot.com](https://www.ternaryplot.com).


A ternary plot is a somewhat obscure diagram often used in geology, soil sciences, metallurgy, biology and chemical engineering. The quickest option available for making ternary plots was using Excel templates, which in my opinion are inflexible and produce ugly plots. Some R and Python libraries exist for this purpose but these are harder to use and require installing R and Python (of course). That's why I made a tool for personal use, and later decided to develop into something slicker and with more options.
